IUT organizes an online short course on ‘Energy Trans ...Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department (EEE) of IUT is going to organize an online short course titled “Energy Transition: Clean, Affordable, Sustainable Perspectives” on 26 - 27December 2020.
Global energy transformation for power generation is moving forward in a promising way that includes renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency improvement for a sustainable energy future.
For new power generation, the global market is dominated by renewable energy technologies. Power generation through solar PV and wind are the cheapest options in many markets and it is expected that within the next decade most of the renewable power sources will compete with fossil fuel-based electricity generation.
The use of fossil fuel-based electricity generation has been showing a declining trend. It is expected to increase the modern renewable energy share in the final energy supply. To develop a sustainable energy future, it is important to design and assess long-term least-cost alternative pathways based on energy modelling for policy planning that focus on improving energy security, energy access, and diversification of energy supply-mix and develop a low-carbon society.
This short course will highlight the scenario of global renewable energy development, cost and investment trend including renewable energy potential and growth by introducing issues like different energy models that are useful for making decisions on energy investment, integration of renewable energy into the power sector and policy planning. The course also intends to address the key challenges being faced by engineers, scientists and academic experts while dealing with renewable energy systems.
The online nomination form is available at shorturl.at/pzBP7
